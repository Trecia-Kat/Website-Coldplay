          <p>Hey there! I'm Trecia and I'm a die hard fan of <a href="coldplay.com">Coldplay</a> . Ever since I was a child, I've been exposed to their songs and I grew fond of them. The first Coldplay song I heard was "Clocks" from their 2002 album, <em><b>A Rush Of Blood To The Head</b></em>, ever since then, I've been a fan. In this article, I'll be discussing some of my favourite albums and top songs. Let me not keep you waiting and let's get into it.</p>

       <h1 class="heading">Top 5 Albums</h1>

      <div class="box-containers">
        <h3 class="album-heading">5) Mylo Xyloto (2011)</h3>

        <img src="album-img/mylo.jpg" alt="mylo xyloto album cover" class="alb-img">

        <p><b>Mylo Xyloto</b> is one of first Coldplay album that I know that unfortunately received a lot of critics from the society. Irregardless, I loved it. Sure, it might not sound like the Coldplay who created <b><em>X & Y</em></b> and <b><em>Viva La Vida</em></b>, but it has some pretty uplifting songs, like <em class="link"><q>Up With The Birds</q></em>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-containers">
        <h3 class="album-heading">4) Viva La Vida (2002)</h3>

        <img src="album-img/viva.jpg" alt="viva la vida album cover" class="alb-img">

        <p><b>Viva La Vida</b> is one of my favourite album, ever! What I love about this album is <em>1)</em> Its album cover (I know its not relevant but I really love paintings!). <em>2)</em>It is filled with happy songs, take for example: <b><em>Strawberry Swing</em></b> or <b><em>Rainy Days</em></b> and <b><em>Lovers In Japan/Reign Of Love</em></b> (I love Japan so much, yay Coldplay!!!) What more could I ask for?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-containers">
        <h3 class="album-heading">3) Ghost Stories (2014)</h3>

        <img src="album-img/ghost.jpg" alt="ghost stories album cover" class="alb-img">

        <p><b>Ghost Stories</b> was a turning point for Coldplay, as they introduced new musical elements and for Chris Martin, as he was was going through his divorce from is then-wife <b>Gwenyth Palthrow</b>. This album is about love, loss and moving on. <b><em>Chris Martin</em></b> (Lead singer) really expressed all his emotions and it reflected in this album. talk about singing your story! </p>

      <div class="box-containers">
        <h3 class="album-heading">2) X & Y (2005)</h3>

        <img src="album-img/xandy.png" alt=" x an y album cover" class="alb-img">

        <p><b>X & Y</b> is the one album I always thought about when I was in Biology or in Maths class (You know, "solve for x and y"). I mean like, come on, it gave us <em>1) Fix You</em>, <em>2) The Hardest Part</em> and lastly <em>3) Speed Of Sound</em>. In my own opinion, I feel that X & Y gave us the best "well written songs" (FYI, all Coldplay songs are awesomely well written), but if you listen to X & Y, its like a story. This album was the peak to Coldplay's career!!! </p>

      <div class="box-containers">
        <h3 class="album-heading">1) Parachutes (2000)</h3>

        <img src="album-img/parachute.jpg" alt="parachutes album cover" class="alb-img">

        <p>No matter which album I listen to, as much as I love every single Coldplay album out there, no album equites to <b>Parachutes</b>!!! Parachutes is just so good, it has a vibe that no other album has provided me. It is chilled, has an element of sadness, depression and loss, its really the ultimate Coldplay album. This was the first album I listened to and from then on, I just really loved it. Sure, Coldplay doesn't sound like they did back in the 2000s, but I lowkey really wish they could release a <q>Parachutes 2</q>, that would be awesome.</p>
